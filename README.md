# Introduction

Russian-specific `geoip.dat` and `geosite.dat` files to use with [v2ray](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core) proxies. 

It adds the following tags to both data files:
- `:antifilter` for sites that are blocked in Russia 
- `:antifilter-community` for sites that block traffic originating from Russian IP addresses

      "outboundTag": "block"
    },
    {
      "type": "field",
      "domain": [ "geosite:antifilter", "geosite:antifilter-community" ],
      "outboundTag": "vless"
    },
    {
      "type": "field",
      "ip": [ "geoip:antifilter", "geoip:antifilter-community" ],
